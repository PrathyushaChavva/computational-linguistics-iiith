By clicking on the experiment lab,we have a dropdown for the selection of the language where we can find english and hindi as options.
we can see the jumbled words there.
the words are clickable buttons.
Now we have to form the form the correct declarative or interrogative sentence with the jumbled words.
So if we click any of the word and that word get removed from the jumbled sentence.
And there is another message comes i.e,, formed sentence.
As we keep clicking the words,the words getting added to the previously chosen words in the same order and the words we chosen get removing from the original jumbled sentence.
there is another clickable button to check the correctness of the sentence.
It tells whether the formed sentence is correct answer or wrong answer
If we want to see the correct answer,there is another button,which displays the correct answer.
